    \item Convergence and Characteristic
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In the case of the method of steepest descent, it is reliable.
        Whatever the function is, Wherever to start, it converges to the optimal point.
        \item In Newton's method, depending on the initial point, it usaully failed to converge.
        Also, in the 3rd function case, it almost failed to converge. 
        Only in the 1st function case, it showed the guaranteed optimal point.
        \item In Quasi-Newton's method, the convergence speed is not that fast as Newton's method.
        Moreover, it has a large dependecy on search a step length alpha. When the alpha value is not that good, 
        it showed the failure cases. Especially, SR1 method is more sensitive to this alpha value.
